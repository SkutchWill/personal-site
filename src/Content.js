const colorPicker = "This project, the capstone for the “Modern React Bootcamp” course, was instructed to be built solely using class-based components.  I decided to use function components and hooks instead to establish a comprehensive understanding of this now standard approach.  Also notable was my implementation of React Router v6 (a new library with minimal usage examples) instead of the deprecated v5 documented in the course.  Finally, I built familiarity with NPM and the React standard of utilizing multiple external packages to accomplish the UX needs not afforded by React alone.  As the largest JavaScript codebase I've written thus far, it's remarkable how much simpler a web app is to understand when its broken up into components.";

const eCommerce = "In this capstone for the “Modern JavaScript Bootcamp” course, I gained exposure to implementation techniques for modern, dynamic web applications.  The project does not contain a single static HMTL file - all HTML is dynamically generated via JavaScript and served to the DOM, an essential technique for scalability. Express.js was utilized to route and manage data to a representative database of local JSON files.  This backend was accessed using the File System Node API to read and write data, simulating a live connection.  Additionally, I implemented a robust authentication protocol using the Crypto Node API to hash and salt passwords.";
